#Diabetic Neuropathy

A project created during the 2015 PACT Healthcare App Challenge.

---

This project aims to combat the worsening of foot ulcers for patients with diabetic neuropathy by alerting the patients when the patient is putting too much pressure on the foot ulcer.

The system consists of two vibrating motors, a spark core, a website (mobile/desktop), and two sensors, though more can easily be added, on both sides of the arch.

As an example, the system is setup to warn the patient when they place too much pressure near the toes of their left foot. The system will warn the patient by flashing the alert button on the webpage while also vibrating the motors, which are warn on a wristband. The patient then shifts weight from the ulcers, which helps them heal.

The system also shows the patient the amount of pressure they are putting on each position in their foot (in Pascals), along with a graphical representation of the current pressure (transparent green to opaque red). It also shows the average pressure, for the patient to monitor themselves. The webpage also graphically shows the difference in pressure between the two feet.
